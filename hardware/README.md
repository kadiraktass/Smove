# Hardware challenge solution  


[Desired hardware](https://github.com/itatsmove/smovechallenge/blob/master/challenges/hardware.md) is designed using [Eagle 9.1.0](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview). Design files, BOM and Gerber files are included in [uno_sensor_shield](https://github.com/kadiraktass/Smove/tree/master/hardware/uno_sensor_shield) folder.
